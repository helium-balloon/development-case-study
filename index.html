      <div class="center">
        <p>
          To practice my skills using React and learn about conducting a
          competitive analysis, I embarked on this Development Study!

        <h2>Competetitive Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          First up, I practiced conducting competitive analysis between
          competitor companies. Through this process, I was able to idently
          strengths and weaknesses in design elements employed by industry
          designers. To do this, I chose 3 companies that utilise a favoriting
          function, Spotify, Gmail, and EdStem. Below is the competitive
          analysis chart I created regarding factors relating to the favoriting
          function on each site.
        </p>

        <div class="half">
          <div class="center">
            <h3>Competitive Analysis Chart</h3>
            <img
              id="chart"
              src="./assets/competitive-analysis.png"
              alt="Competitive Analysis chart"
            />
          </div>
          <div class="take-up-half">
            <p>
              Using these websites, I discovered a lot about how favoriting
              functions work on the three websites I chose - Spotify, Gmail, and
              EdStem.
            </p>
            <div>
              <ul class="list">
                <li>
                  First for Spotify, the user interface design for the liked
                  songs is overall straightforward and similar to both Gmail and
                  EdStem in that you click an icon that changes from outlined to
                  filled in to show that it is liked. In addition, Spotify
                  allows users to easily search for the Liked Songs playlist by
                  typing “liked” into the search bar with no additional search
                  criteria, labels, or filtering. A weakness is that hovering
                  over the heart can be unintuitive because it states the
                  opposite action, as it lets you know what will happen if you
                  click, but this can be confusing if you think that is what the
                  current state is. Additionally, if the Liked Songs folder is
                  not pinned, it could be difficult to find depending on how a
                  user organizes their playlists.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  Next, like Spotify, Gmail also has a specific location where a
                  user can find their starred items. For Gmail, this folder is
                  always located right under the inbox, so you can get there in
                  one click. The hovering is also more intuitive than Spotify as
                  a small note will pop up letting the user know the current
                  state of the starred email. However, to find starred emails by
                  searching, you must use label:starred instead of just
                  searching “starred” which can be slower.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  Thirdly, EdStem’s main strength is having a very simple
                  interface with not many tools or folders on screen. However,
                  for starred posts, this means that there is not a specific
                  folder like Gmail or Spotify, but only by using the filter
                  mechanism can a user filter for starred posts. This is the
                  same for searching much like Gmail, where one cannot search
                  for “starred”, but must filter first then search.
                </li>
              </ul>

        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>TL;DR Strengths and Weaknesses</h3>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>Spotify</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: none">
              <ul class="circle">
                <li>
                  Strengths: can search for whole folder without filtering first
                </li>
                <li>
                  Weaknesses: hovering can be unintuitive; folder could
                  difficult to find if not pinned
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Gmail</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: none">
              <ul class="circle">
                <li>
                  Strengths: easy to find, hovering intuitive tells you if
                  starred or not
                </li>
                <li>
                  Weaknesses: cannot search for all starred must filter instead
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>EdStem</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: none">
              <ul class="circle">
                <li>Strengths: simple interface</li>
                <li>
                  Weaknesses: not a specific folder/location for them besides
                  using the filter; cannot search for all starred must filter
                  instead
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
          Based on what I found in my competitive analysis, I'd like to
          implement the following factors and designs:
        </p>
        <div>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              Easily clickable with visual element for the user to click and see
              an immediate change
            </li>
            <li>
              One place with all the elements of a specific grouping, such as a
              folder
            </li>
            <li>
              Search by keyword, including overall groups (Note: For this
              project, I did not end up adding in this functionality)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>
          For the implementation of an application that uses lists and an
          aggregator, I chose a photo app for my theme where users can like
          photos shown on the page. <br />
          <br />I incorporate filters by allowing users to filter using the
          category of photo (nature, animals, food) and also by size of photo
          (small, medium, large). I incorporate sorting by allowing users to
          alphabetically sort the list of photos by name, helping them find the
          photo they’re looking for. To aggregate, I have a “Favorites” list at
          the bottom of the page. When users click the heart on a photo that
          photo will be added to their favorites list. This allows users to
          create a list with their favorite photos all in one place.
        </p>

          <h2>Conclusions</h2>
          <p>
            Throughout this process, I gained experience with developing
            software in React as well as in conducting a competitive analysis. I
            found it incredibly rewarding to take the design principles talked
            about in class and apply them to an app that works. These same
            principles can be applied to a variety of areas in both professional
            and academic contexts.
